# UI Style Lang (Language)

!["UI Style Lang"](logo.png?raw=true "UI Style Lang")


UI Style Lang is a simple CSS-like language which allows for drawing and styling wxPython elements. Many UI Style Lang properties are the same as the normal (not short-hand) CSS3 properties. This provides a familiar syntax, especially for those with experience with CSS3.

Only part of the drawing API is implemented right now. SVG support is coming soon(?). The wxPython element styling is planned for a later time.

# Features

* Written in pure Python with minimal dependancies (just wxPython and the standard library)
* Over 12 CSS properties already supported
* Draw circles, rectangles, squares, images, & text with the drawing API
* Both loading from inline styles and an external stylesheet is supported

# Development
