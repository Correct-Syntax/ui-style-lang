Welcome to UI Style Lang's documentation!
=========================================

UI Style Lang is a simple CSS-like language for styling and drawing in wxPython. It is created to be easily understood, especially for those who have experience with HTML and CSS concepts.

If you are looking for an easy way to:

* **Draw shapes, text and/or images** in wxPython without worrying so much about ids, brushes, pens, etc.
* **Style the native wxPython widgets** from a stylesheet
* **Create your own custom widgets in wxPython** that can be styled with a CSS-like stylesheet

...then UI Style Lang is likely the module you're looking for.
